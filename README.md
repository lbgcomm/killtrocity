# Killtrocity
## Warning
Killtrocity is a part of a collection of software created by [Christian Deacon](https://github.com/gamemann) and maintained by [Synk](https://github.com/Synkstar). The main project was [LBG's](https://lbgaming.co) Anycast [network](https://status.lbgaming.co/). The core program is a packet processing/filtering application that utilizes [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) (basically a very fast firewall & router for game servers operating on their own network).

These applications were private for a long time and there were no plans to release them publicly. However, here we are. Please keep this in mind if you're reading commits and such ðŸ™‚

**All filters were made by [Synk](https://github.com/Synkstar) since [Christian Deacon](https://github.com/gamemann) is still signed to a non-compete contract where he cannot share filter code they've created for (D)DoS filters and such.**

## Python Modules
```bash
pip3 install websockets
```
